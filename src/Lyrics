Come listen you fellers so young and so fine
And seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine
It'll form as a habit and seep in your soul
Till the stream of your blood is as black as the coal

It's dark as a dungeon and damp as the dew
Where the danger is double and pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines
It's dark as a dungeon way down in the mines

It's many a man, I've seen in my day
Who lives just a laborer his young life away
Where the demons of death often come by surprise
One fall off a slate and you're burried alive

I hope when I'm gone and the ages shall roll
My body will blacken and turn into coal
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home
And pity the miner digging my bones

It's dark as a dungeon and damp as the dew
Where danger is double and pleasures are few
Where the rain never falls and the sun never shines
It's dark as a dungeon way down in the mine
